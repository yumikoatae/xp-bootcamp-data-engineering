# OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

## OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)

OLTP is a data processing approach focused on fast and frequent operations, such as banking transactions, online purchases, or sales records.  
OLTP databases are typically highly normalized to ensure data integrity and support a high number of fast read and write operations.

**Examples:**  
- Banking systems  
- Sales records  
- E-commerce  

## OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

OLAP focuses on analyzing large volumes of data, commonly used in Business Intelligence (BI) for complex queries and reports.  
It uses multidimensional data structures (OLAP cubes) and is optimized for read queries and reports, not for frequent write operations.

**Examples:**  
- Historical data analysis  
- Sales reports  
- Demand forecasting

# Big Data Architecture

## Lambda Architecture

The Lambda Architecture is a data processing model that combines both batch and real-time processing to ensure performance and scalability.  
- **Batch Layer**: Processes large volumes of data in batches, suitable for heavy analytical queries.  
- **Speed Layer**: Processes real-time (streaming) data, providing immediate results for use cases like real-time monitoring or fraud detection.

The combination of these layers offers a robust solution for handling various data types and use cases.

### Advantages
- Scalability for large data volumes.
- Real-time performance for quick decisions.
- Flexibility to handle various data types.
- Resilience, as one layer can continue functioning if the other fails.

### Disadvantages
- Complexity in maintaining two separate layers.
- Potential duplication of processes across layers.
- Higher costs due to the required infrastructure.
- Latency due to batch processing.
- Difficulty in synchronizing between layers.

## Kappa Architecture

The Kappa Architecture simplifies the Lambda Architecture by focusing solely on real-time data processing (streaming). It removes the batch processing layer, handling all data through a single continuous flow.  
This architecture is based on immutable event processing, where all data is treated as a continuous stream of events.  
It is ideal for systems where simplicity and scalability are essential, and there is no need to maintain large-scale historical states.

### Advantages
- Simplicity: No batch layer, making the system easier to implement and maintain.
- Scalability: Handles large volumes of real-time data efficiently.
- Real-time Processing: Data is processed quickly with low latency.

### Disadvantages
- Limitation in Complex Analyses: Difficult to perform advanced analysis on historical data.
- Lack of Historical Data Persistence: Does not store historical data for future analysis.
- Less Flexible for Heavy Analytical Queries.

# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is an architectural style where system components communicate through events, which are messages indicating that something significant has occurred.  
This architecture is highly flexible and decoupled, allowing systems to react to events asynchronously.

**Examples:**  
- Notification systems  
- Real-time payment processing  
- IoT

## Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) Model

Pub/Sub is an asynchronous communication model where "publishers" send messages to a "topic," and "subscribers" receive these messages without needing to know the publishers.  
This model is widely used in messaging and event systems, ensuring decoupled and scalable communication.

**Examples:**  
- Push notifications  
- Alert systems

## Event Streaming

Event Streaming is the technique of processing and analyzing events in real-time as they occur.  
It is used to capture, process, and analyze continuous data streams in real-time. Streaming tools, such as Apache Kafka, are common in this scenario to handle large volumes of data and ensure low latency.

## Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for building real-time data systems.  
It is widely used to handle large data streams, offering high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Kafka uses the Pub/Sub model and stores events in topics, which can be consumed by multiple consumers efficiently.

**Examples:**  
- System monitoring  
- Real-time log analysis  
- Large-scale data processing
